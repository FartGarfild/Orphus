# Oprhus AV Scanner Unified (modular + quarantine + real-time + busybox-first)
# Features:
#   - Built-in signature updater (Maldet, ClamAV, YARA, MalwareBazaar, custom)
#   - Parallel workers with batch hashing (SHA256 + MD5) and YARA batching
#   - Zero-RAM lookup + strict RAM ceiling
#   - Live RAM / CPU / ETA / FPS progress monitor
#   - Full heuristics: strings, hex-ERE, b64 payloads, disguised files, SUID/SGID
#   - Magic-bytes fast filter
#   - Quarantine mode: moves detected files to an isolated directory
#   - Real-time watch mode: background daemon, scans new files as they appear
#   - Pure self-contained single file
#
# BusyBox-first: looks for a local busybox (./bin/busybox); if missing, tries
# to auto-download a static binary (no prompts). Once available, all key ops
# (hashing, strings, find/grep/awk in the signature pipeline) go through it
# instead of $PATH. System tools are only a fallback. Exception: the first
# download itself needs system wget/curl (nothing else to fetch busybox with).
#
# Usage:
#   ./av_scan.sh [OPTIONS]
#
# Options:
#   -u, --update            Update signatures and EXIT (no auto-scan after)
#   -r, --max-ram MB        Max RAM limit in megabytes (default: 500)
#   -j, --workers N         Number of parallel worker processes (default: auto)
#   -d, --dir PATH          Target directory to scan (default: /mnt)
#   -s, --sigs PATH         Signature directory (default: ./signatures)
#   -m, --max-size MB       Max file size for deep inspection in MB (default: 10)
#   -o, --output FILE       Report file. Written to LIVE as threats are
#                            found (not just at the end) — if the scan gets
#                            interrupted, whatever's in this file up to
#                            that point is still valid. Without -o, a
#                            default ./av_scan_threats_<timestamp>.log is
#                            used automatically (never silently discarded).
#                            SUID/SGID findings are written to a SEPARATE
#                            companion file (same name + "-SUID") instead
#                            of mixed into this one — on a full-OS scan,
#                            standard system binaries alone can produce
#                            dozens of lines that bury what actually needs
#                            a look. Only created if there's anything in it.
#   --ignore-sigs FILE       Suppress noisy detections without editing
#                            downloaded signature/rule files (which get
#                            overwritten on the next -u). One ERE pattern
#                            per line, matched against "TYPE|info" of each
#                            detection. Default: signatures/ignore_sigs
#                            (auto-created with a commented template).
#   -X, --exclude PATH        Skip this file/directory entirely (repeat for
#                            multiple: -X /path/one -X /path/two). The AV's
#                            own install dir, signature dir, and quarantine
#                            dir are always excluded automatically.
#   -A, --scan-archives      Look inside archives (.zip/.jar/.tar/.tar.gz/
#                            .tgz/.tar.bz2/.tar.xz/.gz/.bz2/.xz, plus .7z/
#                            .rar if 7z/unrar is installed) — off by
#                            default (extraction has real CPU/time cost and
#                            some risk from malformed/huge archives, hence
#                            the safety limits below). A detection inside
#                            an archive is reported against the ARCHIVE
#                            FILE itself (with the internal member path
#                            noted), not a temp path, and quarantine (if
#                            enabled) moves the whole archive.
#   --archive-max-mb N        Skip archives bigger than this, compressed
#                            (default: 200)
#   --archive-ram-max-mb N    Extract archives up to this COMPRESSED size
#                            straight into RAM (/dev/shm) instead of disk
#                            — faster, especially on IOPS-capped hosts
#                            (default: 50). Bigger archives fall back to
#                            disk regardless of --archive-max-mb.
#   --archive-max-extract-mb N Abort extraction past this much decompressed
#                            data — defense against decompression/zip
#                            bombs (default: 500)
#   --archive-max-depth N     How many nested-archive levels to recurse
#                            into, e.g. a zip containing a zip (default: 2)
#   --archive-max-files N     Only scan the first N files inside one
#                            archive (default: 2000)
#   --yara-timeout SECONDS    Abort a single yara call after this long
#                            (default: 30) — protects against a scan
#                            hanging indefinitely on a pathological file.
#                            On a timeout, that batch is retried one file
#                            at a time with a short timeout each: fast
#                            files still get scanned normally, and
#                            whichever one is actually slow gets reported
#                            (as SCAN_TIMEOUT) and skipped instead of
#                            stalling the whole scan.
#   -L, --long-time           Just LOG any single batch call that takes
#                            longer than --long-time-threshold (default:
#                            20s) — batch type, elapsed time, and the
#                            exact file list — to <output>.slow, without
#                            aborting or changing scan behavior at all.
#                            Survives even a successful finish (a separate
#                            file from the main report, which gets
#                            overwritten with the clean summary at the
#                            end) — tail -f it during a scan to watch live.
#   --long-time-threshold N   Seconds threshold for -L above (default: 20)
#   --sandbox-mode MODE       Isolate archive EXTRACTION (the highest-risk
#                            operation — parsing attacker-controlled zip/
#                            tar/7z/rar) as defense-in-depth against a bug
#                            in the extractor itself being exploited by a
#                            malicious archive. auto|bwrap|unshare|chroot|
#                            simple|none (default: auto — picks the
#                            strongest available: bwrap > unshare >
#                            simple; --sandbox-mode none opts out).
#                            Rewritten from a person's draft after finding
#                            and fixing several real bugs during
#                            review/testing (broken bwrap argument
#                            passing, leaked chroot bind mounts, missing
#                            access to the archive/extraction tool paths
#                            inside the isolated filesystem view).
#   --no-ram                Force /tmp instead of /dev/shm
#   --no-busybox            Fully disable busybox (no auto-download, no local
#                            binary use) — system tools only
#   -b, --busybox PATH      Explicit path to an existing busybox binary
#   --mb-key KEY            MalwareBazaar Auth-Key (optional)
#   -q, --quarantine        Enable quarantine mode (default dir: ./quarantine)
#   --quarantine-dir PATH   Enable quarantine mode with a custom directory
#   --quarantine-perm MODE  chmod mode for quarantined files (default: 0400,
#                            i.e. read-only, not executable)
#   -w, --real-time         After the base scan, switch to background watch
#                            mode: new files get scanned automatically
#                            (inotifywait, or polling as fallback). Also
#                            auto-enables -I (incremental) and dpkg SUID
#                            verification (see both below) — real-time's
#                            whole point is running/watching continuously,
#                            which is exactly when both pay off.
#   --watch-interval SEC    Polling interval for the fallback watcher (default: 5)
#   -I, --incremental        Skip files unchanged (mtime+size) since they
#                            were last found clean, using a persistent
#                            cache under the signature dir. Auto-on for -w;
#                            use --no-incremental to force it off there.
#   --incremental-cache PATH Override the cache file location (default:
#                            signatures/.incremental_cache.tsv)
#   --verify-suid            Verify SUID/SGID files against the distro
#                            package manager's checksum DB (dpkg/rpm) to
#                            suppress known-legitimate system binaries
#                            (sudo, su, mount, ...) and flag ones that
#                            don't match as TAMPERED. Off by default for a
#                            one-off scan (the common case: no cache, run
#                            once — dpkg lookups it'll never benefit from
#                            again aren't worth paying for), auto-on for
#                            -w where catching a system binary getting
#                            swapped WHILE something is watching is the
#                            actual point. Use --no-verify-suid to force
#                            it off even under -w.
#   --low-priority           Renice + ionice this process (and everything
#                            it spawns) to the lowest CPU/disk priority, and
#                            default to a single worker unless -j overrides
#                            — for running unobtrusively alongside other
#                            services on the same box (e.g. -w in the
#                            background long-term).
#   -P, --scan-processes     Check running processes for simple rootkit
#                            indicators: a process whose backing binary
#                            was deleted from disk (still running, but
#                            invisible to any file-based scan — the
#                            classic "malware deletes itself, keeps
#                            running in memory" case), a live process
#                            hashing to a known-malware signature, an
#                            LD_PRELOAD hooking indicator, and a process
#                            visible in /proc but hidden from `ps`. Can
#                            run standalone (no -d needed — just checks
#                            processes and exits) or alongside a normal
#                            file scan. Does NOT and cannot reliably catch
#                            a genuine kernel-level (LKM) rootkit, which
#                            can lie to /proc itself same as any tool.
#   -K, --check-kernel        Check kernel image / initramfs / loaded
#                            module (.ko) files against the package
#                            manager's own recorded checksums (dpkg -V
#                            logic) — a tampered boot file or a module not
#                            owned by any package is a strong persistence
#                            indicator. MEANINGLESS RUN AGAINST THE LIVE
#                            SYSTEM if that system's own kernel is what's
#                            compromised (same limitation as -P — it can
#                            lie to this check too). Only really means
#                            something paired with --offline-root, run
#                            from your host's rescue/recovery boot (every
#                            major provider offers one — the practical
#                            cloud-VPS equivalent of a LiveCD).
#   --offline-root PATH       Point every check (including -K, and the
#                            normal file scan via -d) at a MOUNTED, NOT
#                            BOOTED disk instead of the live filesystem —
#                            e.g. after booting your provider's rescue
#                            system and mounting the suspect disk at
#                            /mnt/suspect-root:
#                              ./av.sh --offline-root /mnt/suspect-root \
#                                -K -d /mnt/suspect-root
#                            This is what makes -K meaningful against a
#                            real kernel-level rootkit — everything reads
#                            through the RESCUE kernel, not a potentially
#                            compromised one. Booting into rescue mode
#                            itself is always a manual step through your
#                            provider's control panel — nothing here can
#                            or should try to trigger that automatically
#                            from within a system you don't trust the
#                            kernel of. Incompatible with -P (no running
#                            processes to inspect on an unmounted disk).
#   --sig-in-ram              Force the compiled signature set (hash/YARA
#                            databases) into /dev/shm specifically,
#                            independent of the general RAM-ceiling
#                            decision that governs everything else — for
#                            powerful boxes with room to spare, guarantees
#                            every batch lookup is a RAM hit instead of
#                            hoping the OS page cache wasn't evicted.
#   --deep, --paranoid        One-off scan with maximum scrutiny: turns on
#                            SUID/SGID package verification and archive
#                            scanning (both -w-only by default), skips
#                            incremental-cache shortcuts, and — the main
#                            point — bypasses EVERY automatic suppression
#                            mechanism (ignore_sigs, the vendor-
#                            obfuscation allowlist) so nothing is
#                            filtered out before you see it. The person
#                            decides what's a false positive, not the tool.
#   --max-hex-patterns N    Cap on compiled hex signature patterns (default:
#                            8000) — grep -E -f cannot build a usable match
#                            automaton from a full real ClamAV .ndb+.ldb set
#                            (100k+ patterns); raising this trades scan
#                            speed for hex-signature coverage
#   --batch-size N            Files per hash/YARA batch (default: 50).
#                            Smaller = smoother progress (threats show up
#                            more incrementally instead of jumping when a
#                            big batch finishes), at some throughput cost.
#   --heur-batch-size N       Files per strings/hex heuristic batch (default: 50)
#   --pe-batch-size N         Files per PE-section/.mdb batch (default: 50)
#   --setup                  Install yara/yarac into bin/ (and fetch busybox
#                            if missing), then exit. Prefers --yara-url if
#                            given; otherwise compiles from source (needs a
#                            C toolchain — auto-installed via whichever of
#                            apt/dnf/yum/zypper/pacman/apk is present).
#   --yara-url URL            Install yara/yarac from a prebuilt tarball at
#                            this URL instead of compiling — no compiler
#                            needed on the target machine. YARA publishes no

# Re-exec into our OWN bundled bash (see build_bash_from_source /

# tooling routinely runs through, /bin/bash among them — narrows how much
# of this scan's own execution ever touches a potentially-tampered

# testing under system bash).
#
# HONEST LIMIT, stated plainly rather than implied: this does NOT fully
# solve the problem. Whatever shell interprets THIS invocation, up to and
# including the moment this check itself runs, is still exposed — no
# script can fully bootstrap trust in its own interpreter from within
# that same interpreter. Real protection comes from copying av.sh +
# bin/bash from a known-clean source and running "./bin/bash ./av.sh"
# directly, never touching system bash at all. This re-exec narrows
# exposure for the common case (person just runs "bash av.sh" or
# "./av.sh"), it does not eliminate it.

    # three downloaders had ANY bound on total transfer size — only
    # --connect-timeout/-T, which cap the CONNECTION/read-idle phase, not
    # the overall transfer. Confirmed directly: curl pulled 740MB from an
    # effectively infinite local source in 5 seconds with nothing
    # stopping it. First attempt at a fix added native per-tool flags
    # (curl --max-filesize/--max-time, wget -Q) on top of this — a real
    # report then came in of THIS WRAPPED download failing on a real
    # server while a plain, bare `curl url --output file` (no extra flags

    # being able to reproduce it directly, all the native per-tool size/
    # time flags are gone — every downloader now just fetches plainly

# MODULE: self-setup (--setup)
#
# Two ways to get yara/yarac into $SCRIPT_DIR/bin/, tried in this order:
#
#   1. --yara-url URL — fetch a PREBUILT tarball (containing "yara" and
#      "yarac" binaries) from a URL you control. Unlike busybox, YARA
#      publishes no official prebuilt binaries, so there's no universal
#      default URL to hardcode here — but if you build once (this same
#      --setup does that) and host the resulting bin/{yara,yarac} tarball
#      on your own mirror/CDN/internal server, every other machine can
#      then install it with a plain download and NO compiler at all,
#      which is both faster and works identically across distros. This is
#      the "do it like busybox" path, just pointed at infrastructure you
#      host yourself instead of a project-run one that doesn't exist.
#
#   2. Compile from source (fallback, or always with --setup --compile).
#      Needs a C toolchain; installed automatically via whichever of
#      apt/dnf/yum/zypper/pacman/apk is present. Different distros name
#      packages differently, so each branch below lists its own package
#      names for the same underlying tools (gcc/make, autotools,
#      pkg-config, OpenSSL dev headers).

# silently finds NOTHING in files containing NUL bytes, even with -a —
# confirmed with a real repro (system grep found the match, busybox grep
# didn't, no error either way). Since binary-safe string search is used
# throughout scanning (webshells embedded in otherwise-binary files,
# SIG_STRING_MATCH, base64 payload screening), a correctness gap here is
# a real, silent detection gap — a bundled, known-good grep closes it for
# good instead of hoping the OS's grep behaves.

# Builds a fully static bash from source — same reasoning as grep/yara
# (guaranteed known-good behavior, no dependency on whatever's on the
# host), but with an ADDITIONAL, distinct motivation: a rootkit that
# patches system binaries (classic technique — Diamorphine, t0rn-style,
# LD_PRELOAD hooking) very often includes /bin/bash itself among the
# tools it tampers with, since bash is what most admin tooling (including
# this scanner) runs through. Re-exec'ing early into a bundled, verified
# bash (see the re-exec check near the top of main()) narrows how much of
# the scan ever touches a potentially-compromised interpreter.
#
# HONEST LIMIT: this does NOT fully solve the problem. If the shell that
# runs THIS SPECIFIC INVOCATION (before the re-exec check even executes)
# is itself compromised, that first fraction of a second of execution is
# still exposed — no script can fully bootstrap trust in its own
# interpreter from within that same interpreter. The real protection
# comes from copying av.sh + bin/bash from a KNOWN-CLEAN source and
# invoking "./bin/bash ./av.sh" directly, never touching system bash at
# all. The re-exec is a narrowing of exposure for the common case (person
# just runs "bash av.sh" or "./av.sh"), not a full guarantee.

    # MODULE: ClamAV format support
    #
    # ClamAV signature files are a family of formats, not one — files are
    # routed by extension to a dedicated parser per format.
    #
    # Supported:
    #   .hdb/.hdu, .hsb/.hsu — file hashes (MD5/SHA256)
    #   .ndb/.ndu            — extended hex signatures with gap quantifiers:
    #                           {n}, {n-m}, {-n}, {n-}, ??, *, (aa|bb) —
    #                           compiled into YARA hex-string rules, not
    #                           grep -E patterns (see note below)
    #   .ldb/.ldu             — logical signatures: subsignatures AND their
    #                           boolean AND/OR expression are reconstructed
    #                           as a proper YARA rule (condition), so match
    #                           precision matches real ClamAV, not a
    #                           degraded "any fragment matches" heuristic
    #   .mdb/.mdu             — PE SECTION MD5 hashes ("size:md5:name").
    #                           The worker parses the PE section table
    #                           itself (see _pe_section_table in the
    #                           embedded worker), hashes each section's raw
    #                           bytes, and batch-matches (size,md5) pairs
    #                           against the compiled mdb.tsv — this is the
    #                           single largest chunk of a real ClamAV
    #                           database (often >50% of its total size),
    #                           so this is worth a real PE parser rather
    #                           than excluding it.
    #
    # Intentionally NOT supported (excluded above, not silently dropped):
    #   .msb/.msu              — PE section SHA256 hashes (same idea as
    #                          .mdb but SHA256) — real-world databases have
    #                          this be a tiny fraction of a percent of
    #                          total signatures (low priority; the MD5
    #                          form above already covers the bulk).
    #   .cdb, .idb            — container signatures / icon hashes, need an
    #                          archive/PE-resource parser we don't have.
    #   .wdb, .pdb, .gdb       — domain/URL signatures, not file content.
    #   .ftm                   — fuzzy hashes (need distance calc, not us).
    #   .fp, .sfp              — KNOWN-CLEAN whitelists, not malware sigs.
    #
    # WHY YARA INSTEAD OF grep -E: a real ClamAV .ndb+.ldb set is tens to
    # hundreds of thousands of hex patterns. grep -E -f rebuilds its match
    # automaton from every pattern on EVERY invocation — empirically, just
    # 10,000 patterns took 4.5s to build ONCE, and 200,000 timed out past
    # 30s. That made scanning thousands of files effectively hang. YARA is
    # built for exactly this (multi-pattern matching at malware-database
    # scale): a compiled ruleset of 50,000 rules loads and matches 500
    # files in under a second. NDB/LDB signatures are compiled into a YARA
    # rules file here, then yarac'd into one binary ruleset alongside any
    # externally-fetched YARA rules (see below), and matched through the
    # same batched process_yara_batch() used for hand-written YARA rules.
    # LDB subsignatures that use PCRE (start with "/") are skipped —
    # PCRE-in-YARA is a distinct syntax we don't attempt to convert; a rule
    # referencing a skipped subsignature is dropped entirely rather than
    # emitting a broken condition.

# MODULE: process/memory anomaly scanning (-P/--scan-processes)
#
# Addresses a specific, real gap in pure file-tree scanning: a process can
# keep running after its own backing executable is deleted from disk (the
# kernel keeps the inode open as long as something references it) — the
# exact "видаляє процес й лишається тільки в ОЗУ" scenario. A file-based
# scanner alone can NEVER see this, no matter how good its signatures are,
# since there's no file left to check.
#
# HONEST SCOPE — stated plainly, not just implied: this catches simple,
# common rootkit techniques (deleted binaries, ps/proc hiding via
# userspace hooks, LD_PRELOAD injection). It does NOT and CANNOT reliably
# catch a genuine kernel-level (LKM) rootkit — one that patches the
# kernel itself can lie to /proc, ps, and every other userspace tool
# equally, INCLUDING this one, since we go through the exact same syscalls
# everything else does. Real detection at that level needs analysis from
# OUTSIDE the running kernel (offline disk/memory forensics), which is a
# fundamentally different tool than a bash-based file/process scanner.
# This module is a real, useful net for the common case, not a guarantee.

# MODULE: kernel/boot integrity check (-K/--check-kernel, --offline-root)
#
# THE POINT OF THIS MODULE ONLY HOLDS IF RUN FROM A TRUSTED KERNEL. Run
# against the LIVE system, this is no better than scan_processes() above —
# still going through whatever kernel is currently running, which a real
# LKM rootkit fully controls and can lie to just like anything else. Its
# real value is when paired with --offline-root: boot your host's rescue
# system (every major provider — Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Vultr, OVH,
# etc. — offers one; it's the practical cloud-VPS equivalent of a LiveCD,
# just triggered manually through their control panel, not something this
# script can do FROM WITHIN a system you don't trust the kernel of), mount
# the suspect disk read-only somewhere (e.g. /mnt/suspect-root), then run:
#   ./av.sh --offline-root /mnt/suspect-root -K -d /mnt/suspect-root
# Now every check here reads through the RESCUE kernel, not the
# potentially-compromised one — which is the entire reason this is
# meaningfully different from running it live.
#
# Checks: kernel image + initramfs + loaded-module files against the
# package manager's OWN recorded checksums (dpkg -V) — a tampered boot
# image or an unowned .ko file are strong persistence indicators. This
# reuses the exact same "package should own this system file" logic
# already built for SUID/SGID verification, just aimed at /boot and
# /lib/modules instead.
#
# ON REMEDIATION: this deliberately only ever REPORTS. A confirmed kernel/
# boot-level compromise is not something to try to surgically fix in
# place — standard incident response is full reinstall from a known-clean
# image, not disinfection, precisely because nothing on a kernel-level-
# compromised system can be trusted to judge its own cleanliness anymore.
# This module's job is to hand you the evidence to make that call, not to
# pretend it can quarantine a kernel the way it quarantines a PHP file.

# ARCHIVE gets quarantined (moving just the extracted copy would leave the
# infected archive sitting right where it was).

# Safety limits (all overridable via CLI flags — see usage):
#   - skip archives bigger than ARCHIVE_MAX_MB compressed
#   - abort extraction past ARCHIVE_MAX_EXTRACT_MB decompressed (bomb guard)
#   - only look at the first ARCHIVE_MAX_FILES members
#   - only recurse ARCHIVE_MAX_DEPTH levels into nested archives
#   - every extraction command runs under `timeout`, so a malformed/hostile

# MODULE: sandboxed extraction (optional, --sandbox-mode)
#
# Archive extraction is the highest-risk operation in this whole script:
# it parses an ATTACKER-CONTROLLED file format (zip/tar/7z/rar) with
# external tools that have historically had real vulnerabilities (path
# traversal / "zip slip", decompression bombs, parser buffer overflows).
# This wraps that extraction in an isolation layer as defense-in-depth —
# a bug in unzip/tar/7z exploited by a malicious archive is far less
# dangerous running as an unprivileged, network-less, filesystem-isolated
# process than running as whatever this scanner itself runs as (often
# root, to reach protected files).
#
# Off by default (SANDBOX_MODE=none) — this changes nothing unless
# explicitly requested via --sandbox-mode, and even then only wraps
# archive extraction, not the rest of the scan.
#
# Rewritten from a person's own draft (credited to a suggestion from
# another AI) after finding two real, serious bugs in it during review:
#   1. bwrap mode had "2>/dev/null || true" INSIDE a backslash-continued
#      argument list — that's not a per-argument fallback, it's a real
#      shell "||", so bwrap's later arguments (--proc, --tmpfs, --uid,
#      --gid, and the command to actually run) were silently NEVER
#      passed at all. Confirmed by reproducing the exact pattern: only
#      the arguments before the first "|| true" ever reached the command.
#   2. chroot mode bind-mounted 5 directories but only ever `rm -rf`'d the
#      chroot dir afterward — never unmounted them. Every archive
#      processed would leak 5 more stale bind mounts, accumulating for
#      the life of a long-running scan.
# Both fixed below: conditional binds are built into an ARGS ARRAY with
# separate statements before bwrap ever runs (no inline "|| true" inside
# its argument list), and chroot mode unmounts everything (in reverse
# order) in a trap before removing the directory.
#
# SANDBOX_MODE/SANDBOX_USER/SANDBOX_MEM_KB/SANDBOX_CPU_SEC are already set
# from positional params above (33-38) — no re-declaration needed here.
